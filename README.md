- A Raspberry pi 3, with its alimentation
- The [OSOYOO starter kit] (https://www.amazon.fr/OSOYOO-Raspberry-Electronique-explorateurs-amateurs/dp/B074YZMRC1)
- A [night vision camera module] (https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B071J14338)
-- with a longer cable : [30cm](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01NAXKTDP)  or [20cm](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00RMV2L0M)

To build the body, the head, the arms of your robots, you can use Cardboard, or balsa, on thin woods.
